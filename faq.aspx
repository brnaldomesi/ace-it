                            <p>With an average of seventeen years experience, our licensed auditors evaluate the damage estimate and apply parts pricing and procedure times contained in Mitchell's UltraMate estimating software. On occasions in which damages do not match the description of loss, we will suggest a visual inspection.</p>

                            <p>No, that would present our auditors with a fundamental conflict of interest. Other companies have what initially sounds like a great marketing angle: "If we do not at least save the amount of our fee, there's no charge!" However, this betrays a lack of understanding of the whole process. Our auditors are not shooting for net savings, they are auditing estimates for fairness and accuracy. When <span class="fancy-font">ACE</span> pronounces an estimate fair and in line you can pay it with peace of mind, which is a service rendered in and of itself.</p>

                            <p>If he overpaid in good faith our customer is under no obligation to compound that mistake by repeating it. The respondent is also responsible to act in good faith on the part of his policy holders and/or stock owners to make due diligence not to overpay for anything. The applicant should approach the vendor that overcharged and demand reimbursement. For instance, one applicant paid $950 for a $9.50 headlamp relay, another paid $280 an hour for labor instead of $28, easily recoverable overpayments.</p>
